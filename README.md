This repository contains the code I'm using to develop calibration models for my research. The first file I run is "clean_CAMP_data.ipynb," which I use to plot the data, look for any obvious outliers, and remove them. Next, I run "Data Filtering_v2.ipynb" and use a FIR filter to smooth the data. Then, I use "feature_creation_no_smoothing.ipynb" to create additional features by transforming the original features. Finally, I develop the model using the file, "CAMP_calibrations.ipynb." All of the functions called in "CAMP_calibrations.ipynb" are in "regression_functions.py." I'm still editing this code on a regular basis, so it's constantly changing.
