#Regression Machine Learning

This repository contains the code I'm using to develop calibration models for my research. The code for creating regression models is in "CAMP_calibrations.ipynb." All of the functions called in "CAMP_calibrations.ipynb" are in "regression_functions.py." I'm still editing this code on a regular basis, so it's constantly changing. 

- "clean_CAMP_data.ipynb" is used to plot the data, look for any obvious outliers, and remove them
- "Data Filtering_v2.ipynb" uses a FIR filter to smooth the data
- "feature_creation_no_smoothing.ipynb" is used to create additional features by transforming the original features
